Readme for gnome-shell-extension-frugalware-logo
----------

This is a gnome-shell extension that adds a Frugalware logo
to the Activities button of the shell.
(On right-to-left locales it appears on the top right corner,
otherwise on the top left corner.)

The extension is supposed to work with any Gnome shell theme.
(Tested with some popular ones and the default one.)

Special thanks to:
 - Timur Krist√≥f for his work for Fedora logo extension
 - Elad Alfassa for testing it on right-to-left locales.
 - Rahul Sundaram for reviewing this package before submission.
