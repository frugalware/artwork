New Wave Lock-Dialog Theme

Installation:

1. Unpack files to /usr/share/gnome-screensaver/

2. Open gconf-editor (Alt+F2, type 'gconf-editor' and press enter) change the entry apps/gnome-screensaver/lock_dialog_theme from 'default' to 'newwave'

3. Enjoy!


To enjoy this theme fully I recommend using a picture of your choice of size 96x96 px. You could change your current one by going to System > Preference > About Me and click on the button besides your name.

If you want to get back you old theme you should do step 3 in reverse: replace 'newwave' with 'default'
